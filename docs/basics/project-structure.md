## node_modules/
**This will only be here if you've already installed your dependencies**. Contains all files and scripts for
your installed packages.

## src/

contains your bot's files.

### index.(js/ts)
This is your project's main entry point, it contains the code that initializes all your command and event files.

### register(gl/gu or both).(js/ts)

### commands/
This folder contains all of the commands for your bot.

### events/

#### ready.(js/ts)
Basic starter event, is called once the bot is online, currently logs to the console.
