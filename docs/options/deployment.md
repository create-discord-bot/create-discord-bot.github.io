# Deployment

Deployment/registering commands is in layman's terms; publishing your commands over to Discord's servers.
Deploying commands are required as if not done any metadata about the command, such as command name, description, options, etc. will not update nor new commands will appear as well.

:::caution
Discord rate limits the amount of deployments you can have per day to 200.
:::

## Global Deployment

Any files in `commands/` that end with `.(js/ts)` will be deployed to all servers.

You can call it by running the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy:global
```

:::tip
You can remove the `GUILD_ID` portion of your .env file if you're only going to be using global deployment.
:::

## Guild Deployment

Any files in `commands/` that end with `.gu.(js/ts)` will be deployed to the guild id written in your .env file.

You can call it by running the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy:guild
```

:::tip
You can get a server's guild id by right-clicking on the server's icon and clicking the `Copy ID` button.

## Where to deploy

> Guild-based deployment of commands is best suited for development and testing in your own personal server.
> Once you're satisfied that it's ready, deploy the command globally to publish it to all guilds that your bot
> is in.
>
> You may wish to have a separate application and token in the Discord Dev Portal for your dev application, to
> avoid duplication between your guild-based commands and the global deployment.
